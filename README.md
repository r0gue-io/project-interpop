# Project InterPop
Project InterPop is a community-driven initiative to create cutting smart contracts utilizing trustless interoperability between Polkadot's parachains / rollups. 

Pop Network exposes a Messaging API that uses a hybrid between XCM and Polytope Labs ISMP. This enables dual communication between smart contracts and parachains; 
a smart contract can both execute and read data from a parachain. This is something uniquely suited to Polkadot, and likely a first of its kind in any ecosystem.

**Note, the Messaging API is in an alpha state, and is subject to change.**

## Goal of this Repository
This repository will serve as the hub for examples, docs, frontends, and more. By building out this library, we can make these smart contracts more accessible to 
many developers, while also improving the overall quality of the codebase.
